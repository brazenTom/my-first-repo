The GitHub repository should *only* have the following three files:
1. Bash script called guessinggame.sh
2. a makefile
3. A markdown file called README.md

1. guessinggame.sh should have the following behavior:
* When program starts, user asked how many files are in the current directory, then prompt for a guess.
* If answer is wrong the user should be told their guess was either too low or too high, then they should be prompted to guess again.
* If answer is right then they should be congratulated and the program should end.
* The program should not end until the user has entered the correct number of files in the current directory.
*Program should be run by entering bash guessinggame.sh into the console.
*The program should contain one function, loop, and IF statement.
*Program should be more than 20 lines of code and less than 50.

2. The makefile should produce the README.md which should contain the following information:
* Title of project
* Date and time at which the make was run.
* Number of lines of code contained in guessinggame.sh

3. README.md should be produced entirely from the makefile and should not be edited by hand.
* The second URL should be the GitHub Pages site that is generated from the READ.me file.


* ALL CRITERIA ABOVE MUST BE MET TO RECIEVE FULL CREDIT!!
